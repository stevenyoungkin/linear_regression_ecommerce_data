# linear_regression_ecommerce_data
This was the linear regression project from the Udemy course: Python for Data Science and Machnie Learning  

If there is a problem opening the notebook, please go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the link to the notebook there to view it. This seems to be a recurring issue on GitHubs backend. For more info see: https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11

Note to the interpretation of the coefficients. In the simplest case one would assume a balanced design in which the predictors are not correlated. The coefficients are interpreted as the average effect on Y, the target variable, of a one unit increase in X, the predictor, holding all other predictos fixed. This is the case assumed in this project.
